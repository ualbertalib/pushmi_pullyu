# Sample configuration file for PushmiPullyu.
# Options here can still be overridden by cmd line args.

# Pass this file at config/pushmi_pullyu.yml and PushmiPullyu will
# pick it up automatically. Or pass this file into pushmi_pullyu on command line
# via `pushmi_pullyu -C path/to/pushmi_pullyu.yml`

# PushmiPullyu will run this file through ERB when reading it so you can
# even put in dynamic logic, like consuming ENV Variables.
